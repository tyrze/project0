# Project 0 - Colin Goodier

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a university squash club website. 

1) The homepage has title (University Squash Club), and some information on club membership fees, and the club box-league.
     Stylesheets used are bootstrap4 and my.css (my own styles). The page uses the bootstrap 'breadcrumb' component for 
     navigation across the website. The bootstrap 'container' layout is used to divide the page up into 3 columns. The leftmost
     column contains an image of a squash-player (sourced from 'freepik', and attributed acordingly). The footer contains 
     a 'copyright' line, filled by a '@media' CSS 'content' selector.
     
2) The second page is for squash court 'bookings'. The page is divided into two columns, using the bootstrap4 'container'
     column layout. The leftmost column contains a table displaying the squash court 'bookings' (just hard-coded at this stage),
     and the rightmost column some text for squash-players' guidance. Again, navigation is achieved using the bootstrap4 
     'breadcrumb' component. The footer is displayed as described above. SCSS inheritance has been used for the 'table',
     'th' and 'td' selectors to reduce repetition. SCSS 'values' are also used in the CSS applied to this page, for 'td'and 'th' selectors.

3) The third page is 'rules' for a squash box-league.  Again the bootstrap4 'container' column component is used to divide the
     page up into two columns, and navigation is via the bootstrap 'breadcrumb'. Some use of SCSS 'nesting' is used to style 
     <span> tags within the <ul> tags, to highlight sections of the text. The footer is achieved as previously described. SCSS 'values'
     are used in styling the <span> tags.
     
4) The fourth page is for some 'links' to websites of interest to squash-players. Again the page is divided into two columns 
     using the bootstrap 'container' column layout. Navigation is by the bootstrap 'breadcrumb' component. The footer is 
     achieved as described for the previous pages.
     
     4 pages comprise the website, as described above.
     
      Two unordered lists are used, on the 'Box Rules' and 'Links' pages.
     
     An image is displayed on the homepage (sourced from 'freepik', and attributed acordingly).
     
     A table is used on the 'Bookings' page.
     
     The stylesheets used are the bootstrap4 stylesheet, and 'my.css' (my own additions). These are used on all four pages.
     
     CSS properties used include color, font-style, font-size, font-family, font-weight, text:align, background-color, border, 
	    margin, margin-left, margin-top, width, display, content.
          
     CSS selectors used (across the site) are div, th, td, ul, li, p, h1, h2, header, section, footer, span, id and class.
  	    
     One #id selector, and one .class selector are used.
          
     A mobile-responsive @media query is used to fill in the 'copyright' line at the foot of the website pages. A shorter version
     is displayed if the screen 'viewport'  is below 501px.
     
     Bootstrap4 is used on all pages. Navigation is achieved by using the Bootstrap 'breadcrumb' component, and all four 
     pages use the Bootstrap 'grid model' to divide the page up into columns.
     
     My stylesheet uses three SCSS values (refer to the top of 'my.css'), one example of SCSS nesting, and two of SCSS inheritance.
     All viewable at the top of 'my.css'.
