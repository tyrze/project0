	     <h4>Box-league rules</h4>
	
	     	<ul>
		   <li>Generally, the winner and runner-up from each box will move up one level, 
		   while the bottom two will move down a level. The 2 (or more) remaining middle 
		   players stay in the same box for the next box-league. There may be some variation 
		   in this process, as players drop out of the box-league, or new players join. Usually 
		   we will attempt to slot players in at a point appropriate to their standard, so this may 
		   affect the promotion/demotion issues<br /><br /></li>
		   
		   <li>Matches will be scheduled at a <span>mutually agreeable time and place by both players</span>. 
		   This can be at any available court, provided both players agree on the venue<br /><br /></li>
		   
		   <li>Matches may be played at any time during the period of the box-league, but <span>must be 
		   completed and reported before midnight of the last day of the box-league period</span><br /><br /></li>
		</ul>

	    <div class="col-sm">
	    
	    <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
	    
	    <ul>
		<li>Any player who fails to show for a box match that has been mutually scheduled <span>may be 
		assessed as having lost the match 0-3</span>, unless both players agree to a re-scheduled date. <br /><br /></li>
		
		<li>The box coordinator will verify the 'no show' by contacting both the players involved. 
		If the 'no-show' is verified the player who was present at the scheduled time will be allotted
		5 points (a 3-0 win) and the match will count as being played for that person<br /><br /></li>
		
		<li>Players <span>must complete at least one of their matches</span> to be automatically included in the 
		next month's box<br /><br /></li>
		
		<li>Players may enter or exit the box league by informing the box coordinator before the 
		beginning of the next box-league. <br /><br /></li>
